Hello @playerone I have a very important task for you today, many of our services require a fully functioning MySQL database to function correctly. I need you to ensure that the integrity of our employees MySQL database is sound. I have chosen Thanh, one of the developers here at DAS Web  Inc to explain this in further detail.

Greetings @playerone, as you are aware our senior System Admin, Gary Thatcher has asked me to explain this task to you. We require that you do a full backup of the MySQL database “employees” on the Debian Database system at 172.16.20.4. This database must then be migrated to our backup server at 172.16.30.79 and it should be restored and the integrity of the restored database should be checked using mysqlcheck.

This task needs to be completed ASAP @playerone, don't let me down!

To recap, @playerone you must
1. Backup the MySQL employees database from 172.16.20.4
2. Migrate the MySQL employees database dump to 172.16.30.79
3. Restore the employees database into a new database named employeestest on 172.16.30.79
4. Compare the original database to the restored backup and run an integrity check on the restored database.
