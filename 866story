Hi there @playerone welcome to your new position as a DAS Web help desk technician.So,  Gary Thatcher our senior admin has tasked me with fixing Sergio Chanel’s various issues I have decided to delegate this task to you as I think it would be better suited for you as a first assignment. 

Sergio Chanel
My R drive is running very slowly and I really didn’t feel like bothering anyone with it so I fiddled with a few setting hoping to fix the sluggishness.

Sergio Chanel
My drive and access to LedgerSMB no longer work! This is fabulously frustrating as I can not get any of my work done!!

Billy Gates
@playerone Sergio is having some major problems with the drive he uses called “Intermediary Reports” with a drive letter of R, this drive is used to hold incomplete reports before they are committed to the company hr fileshare. Because of his “fiddling” the drive no longer shows up at all. Furthermore, Sergio is also having problem with LedgerSMB he gets a HTTP 404 Not Found error. 

Billy Gates
In summary @playerone you are tasked with

1. Getting Sergio’s drive accessible again
2. Getting LedgerSMB accessible again.

Good luck!
